# Logging and Exception Handling Improvements

## Centralized Logging Configuration

- Created `app/core/logging_setup.py` with comprehensive configuration for different environments
- Added structured JSON logging for production and readable formats for development 
- Implemented proper log rotation for production logs

## Global Exception Handlers

- Created `app/core/exception_handlers.py` with handlers for different exception types
- Added standardized error responses with consistent format
- Implemented proper logging of exceptions with context information

## Request Context

- Created `app/core/request_context.py` for tracking request-specific data
- Implemented context variables to store request ID, user ID, and other information
- Added a filter to inject context data into log records

## Request Logging Middleware

- Implemented `RequestLoggingMiddleware` to log request/response details
- Added timing information and status code tracking
- Set different log levels based on response status codes

## Updated Exception Hierarchy

- Enhanced `AppException` base class with standardized fields
- Updated all exception classes to properly inherit from the base class
- Added status codes and error codes for consistent API responses

## Enhanced Authentication

- Improved token validation with better error messages
- Added user context to log records for easier tracking
- Implemented proper error handling for authentication failures

## Security Headers Middleware

- Kept the existing security headers middleware
- Added environment-specific security policies

These changes provide a robust logging and exception handling framework that will make debugging easier, provide better error messages to clients, and ensure consistent error handling throughout the application.

## Testing Instructions

1. Start your application and make API requests to verify the logging output
2. Check that errors are properly formatted and returned with consistent structure
3. Test authentication flows to ensure proper error handling
4. Verify that request IDs are properly propagated through the system
